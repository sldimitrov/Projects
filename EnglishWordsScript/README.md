 Automation project for school learning. This is the innovative way that
 I am learning new words right now - by using them in sentences.
 How to use the script:
1. Input the words or phrases into a txt file every one on a new line.
2. Initialise another empty file (sentences_list.txt) in this example (or you can just change the path as you like) to save the written sentences.
3. Run the program and translate every word(https://translate.google.bg/?hl=bg), then put it in a sentence.
4. Once the program has been terminated the last step is re-reading the output file as many times as needed to memorise the whole sentences and then the meaning of the new words as well.
5. If that project helps you in one way or another don't forger to put a star on my sky ;)

# Description #
This calculator has all of the most commonly-used math operations ➗ It looks basic itself on the first look but it's a program that could help you understand why writing code in a function is helpful and why we should use them ➕ They are the tool that allow us to write some functionallity once but use it countless times ✖️ This thing saves us money and time, of course, which is our most-valuable resource ✔️ Without further delay let me introduce you ➖ My calculator!(´｡• ◡ •｡`) ♡

# Live demo #

# Knowledge stack #
Python was involved, of course.
To exercise with functions were the main scope of the script. There are also some text-processing operations in it, if-else-statements, Loops and that's all.

# Screenshots #
* The menu() functions, that only prints the menu below.
Once you terminate the program the same menu function is called and you can see the first messages that appears in the console. The program is waiting for the user to choose between 6 options.

# Adjustments #
Fork the repository and free to show imagination - change the script.
* express yourself
* add new functionality
* add try-except statements
* add more user-friendly messages
* add whatever you want and said feedback ;)
* JUST do NOT forget to *fork* and *star* the repo!
```python 
print('Thank you for the attention!' * n_times)
```
