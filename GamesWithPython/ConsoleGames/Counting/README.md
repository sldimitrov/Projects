# Description #
Guess a number between 1 and 100!
The game is something like playing on warm and cold. Each time you enter your guess the program tells you wether you should go up or down. My personal best is winning it with just two moves. It's your turn to beat me now!

# Screenshots #
* The menu() functions, that only prints the menu below.
Once you terminate the program the same menu function is called and you can see the first messages that appears in the console. The program is waiting for the user to choose between 6 options.
