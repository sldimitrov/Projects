# Adjustments #
Hello viewer! I am so glad that you are reading this. I hope you like my project and if I am right dont forget to Star-up the repository!

In this header I am going to show you some things you can change in the code to make the game look alike it's your own.

* Change the text on the down-right angle.
First go to **line 111** of the code and replace - "text = 'made by SL'" with 'made by Leonardo Da Vinci', for example

```python 
points = canvas.create_text(430, 370, text='made by SL', font=(('Agbalumo', 15)))
```
