# Description #
This calculator has all of the most commonly-used math operations ‚ûó It looks basic itself on the first look but it's a program that could help you understand why writing code in a function is helpful and why we should use them ‚ûï They are the tool that allow us to write some functionallity once but use it countless times ‚úñÔ∏è This thing saves us money and time, of course, which is our most-valuable resource ‚úîÔ∏è Without further delay let me introduce you ‚ûñ My calculator!üñ•

# Technology stack #
Python was involved, of course.
I had also used several libraries.
Tkinter, random and time.

# Screenshots #
Here you can see the full start-screen. 
The game is waiting for the user to press Space.

# Adjustments #
Hello viewer! I am so glad that you are reading this. I hope you like my project and if I'm right don't forget to *star or fork the repository*!

In this header I am going to show you some things you can change in the code to make the game look alike it's your own.

* Change the text on the down-right angle.
First go to **line 111** of the code and replace - "text = 'made by SL'" with 'made by Leonardo Da Vinci', for example

```python 
points = canvas.create_text(430, 370, text='made by SL', font=(('Agbalumo', 15)))
```
* To change the color of the ball you should go to line 108
```python 
ball = Ball(canvas, paddle, 'red')
```

* And for the color of the paddle - line 107
```python 
paddle = Paddle(canvas, 'gold')
```
# In fact, you can change whatever you want! These were just few examples of how the game could be modified. Thank you for the attention, see you in the next project! ;)#
