# Additional project

* This project was set as an additional exersice by my lecture in the Fundamentals module (The second one in my development plan). 
*I love to accept every challenge that is in front of me. This is the reason why I didn't only made the project but i expanded it with new features, which you can check if you fork the repo. 

*Feel free to add your personal magic to it whenever you want and send a merge request if you want to!*
