£ This project contains the 19th most used passwords for 2023. £

It imitates the proccess of guessing every symbol of the plain-text password. In fact, today's applications are encrypted so even if you reach the database of the 
server you still have so much work to do.

They are saved in a list and We are using an empty string and nested-for-loops to find every one of the symbols in it. 

This was ,,hacked'' all of the most-used passwords in under 1 second by using this simple script.

£ Test it yourself and see! £
