# Documentation

# Description #
This program takes a directory path as a paramether. Once we have the directory in we run the program. Then we are asked what symbol we want to replace.
* For example we want to remove the spaces ' ' from our file names and replace them with '' - empty string. Okay,
the only thing you need to do is to input these values into the console once the program was run and that's all.
